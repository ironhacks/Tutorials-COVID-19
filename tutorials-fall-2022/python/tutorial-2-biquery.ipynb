    "\n",
    "**Our goal**: Help you get started with the Python BigQuery Library, Python Pandas Library and Python Numpy Library in order to access a first temporal dataset stored in BigQuery! So if you have never used these libraries before this tutorial is critical for you."

    "BigQuery is Google's flagship data warehousing system: \"Serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse designed for business agility\". It allows you to analyze large amount of data using ANSI SQL at blazing-fast speeds, with zero operational overhead. You can find out more it at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we use BigQuery?** In the Unemployment Data Science Challenges you will use BIG DATA from our data provider, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD). Using Big Query will be very helpful as you can explore data without having to use them in memory etc. It will also set you up for the future of data science since BigQuery is replacing other BIG DATA services (e.g. Spark).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we give you access to BigQuery?** In Big Query data are stored in projects. Inside a project there are multiple datasets. Each dataset can contain multiple tables. In this hack we give you access to a project called: `ironhacks-data`. In this project there are two datasets:`ironhacks-data:ironhacks_training` and `ironhacks-data:ironhacks_competition`. During the training period you will only find data in the first dataset. In this first tutorial we only use one first relatively simply structured table stored in this dataset. It is called `covid19_cases`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind**: In this tutorial you will learn how to get access to the ironhacks-covid19-data and the datset ironhacks-covid19-data:ironhacks_covid19_training stored inside this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's BigQuery**: Google Cloud Big Query package allows you to query data stored in BigQuery You can find the official documentation [here](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's Pandas** In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's Numpy** NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays\n",
