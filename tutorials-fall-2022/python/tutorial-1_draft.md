In this tutorial, the goal is to learn about how to use Jupyter notebooks and be able to learn about the tools avaliable to you in the Jupyterhub enviroment that Ironhacks provides to you

## Getting Started with your Notebook

To access your Ironhacks Jupyter Notebook, all you need to do is click the Workspace button in the main Hack page and the enviroment will automatically load and open in a new tab.

Once you get in, you are greeted with an enviroment similar to any IDE you may have worked with in the past. To create an notebook, all you have to do is hit **File->Create New Notebook** and a new Python notebook will open up. 

### What is a Cell?
Once you get here, you can start coding! Notebooks typically use **cells** to section each part you write. You may create Text or Code cells. Text cells will help you explain your code or just keep notes for yourself to help you stay on track. Code cells will be any code that you write that the complier will run. Code cells can be run individually or all at once, making it easier to debug or run code, whichever you may choose when you develop your own code for this challenge.

For running code, all you need to do is go to the toolbar near the top of the enviroment and hit play. It should look like the image below.
