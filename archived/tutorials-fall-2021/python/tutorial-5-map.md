## Data Maps in Python Notebooks

Maps are an excellent way to communicate the output data of your models visually. 

There are many options for mapping libraries and tools available. For this exercise we focus on [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for python.

For this tutorial you will use several of the skills learned in the previous [tutorials](https://ironhacks.com/hacks/covid-19-data-science-challenge-spring-2021/tutorials).

To get started load up the [**example notebook**](https://ironhacks.com/notebook-viewer?path=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironhacks/Tutorials-COVID-19/master/tutorials-Spring-2021/python/tutorial-5-leaflet-maps.ipynb) in the Hub and begin by replacing the example data with the output from your own models.
