  <strong>RULES</strong><br/>
  <span>IronHacks Data Science Training Challenge - Spring 2022 - Python</span>
</h1>

**#1 Individual work considering privacy:** In this IronHacks Data Science Challenge, individuals compete individually while being part of a larger cohort. You can see the submission of other members in the same cohort. However, for privacy reasons we use pseudonyms. Please do not communicate with other members outside of the challenge to prevent negative experiences. If we realize that you violate our rule of privacy and communicate with other participants, you might not be eligible for an award. 

**#2 Minimum number of submissions:** To qualify for prizes, you need to adhere to the submission requirements detailed in the Task statement. The submissions are accessible via the submission page once it is open!
Please watch out for the updates on the announcement board. For those submissions, participants have to submit the mandatory files
(.csv, .html, .ipynb) within significant content. A submission has significant content related to the task.
*Empty or nonsense submissions are not eligible.*

**#3 Use of the IronHub:** To qualify for prizes, you have to use the workspace of IronHacks: A Jupyter Lab. In order to make sure you earn
sufficient credit for your experimentation and exploration effort, we ask you to use our notebook template and run the commands there on
a regular basis. Check the tutorial for more guidance. 

**#4 Support of scientific research:** This challenge is funded by the National Science Foundation. It supports scientific research on the
socio-technical design of digital platforms for data science learning and innovation. Thus, in order to be eligible for prizes you are
asked to fill in pre- and post-hack surveys, along with small surveys at the end of each submission.  We appreciate your support!

**#5: Language and libraries to be used in JupyterLab:** In this challenge, you are required to program in Python. We have pre-installed an extensive list of Python libraries in
[Python](https://bit.ly/377ly6m) in your personal JupyterLab. Unless communicated otherwise, those are the eligible Python libraries for this
contest.

**#6: Data usage and policy:** In this hack you have access to pre-processed data owned by the Indiana DWD. In
this contest you are not allowed to use any data other than what you can access with the key available in your user profile. After the
competition your right to access and use this data expires unless you request further access from the IronHacks team.

**#7 IronHacks Honor Code:** During the contest, follow the IronHacks Honor Code: You are required to you create and submit your own work. You are allowed to reuse external sources though as long as they are cited. In case you need additional information besides the work accessible via the platform (e.g. help functions in the Python libraries, official
documentation about libraries shared with you in the list of eligible libraries) you have to cite those and reference them in your submission file in a way so that they can be tracked via a working URL or a DOI.

**#8 Ownership of your code:** By participating in IronHacks you acknowledge that your submission can be used for non-commercial purposes
by the IronHacks team (e.g. use in research or publication of showcases). By participating you agree to a creative commons license.
