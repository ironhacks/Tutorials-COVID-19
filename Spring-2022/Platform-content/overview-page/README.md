## The Spring 2022 IronHacks Training Challenge

> Learn to use Jupyter Notebooks and BigQuery for exploratory data analysis using COVID-19 and Indiana Department of Workforce Development data to predict unemployment claims in Indiana!


This is our fourth COVID-19 Data Science Challenge powered by IronHacks. It is part of IronHack’s new data science program, focused on COVID-19. This challenge runs for 6 weeks, so it is geared towards learning and iteration. This means that even if you are new to data science it is an excellent opportunity for you to get learn by doing! Further, this challenge focuses on a really important topic: the economic impact on our citizens from COVID-19! 

## The task and the data: Predicting unemployment claims in the State of Indiana using DWD and COVID-19 data

COVID-19 has impacted citizens significantly. Many employers and industries had a hard time retaining employees and patrons as people stayed away from eating out and were required to work from home given the risk of virus spread inside closed buildings. As additional restrictions are either lifted or reimplemented and citizens get vaccinated, governments and corporations need to understand how much and where people are most economically impacted.  An increase in the number of unemployment claims can indicate emerging trends in economic activity. Thus, in this challenge, our task is to predict the unemployment claims in Indiana in order to understand the continuing COVID-19 impact and risk. We preprocessed very large, actual, and granular datasets from our partners. We will update this data on a continuous basis so that you have real-time data available. You will use this data to develop a predictive statistical model and communicate the results using data charts and maps. You will have the opportunity to make up to twelve predictions over the duration of the hack. With such predictions, you have the unique opportunity to help the state and leaders to use the outcome of your models and visualizations to monitor and predict economic impact. More details can be found in the task statement when it is released at the start of the competition. 

## Your workspace

During the competition, you will use the new IronHacks workspace that supports a fully integrated data science workflow: You will have access to a **JupyterLab**, a key, and libraries to query and analyze data from **BigQuery**. Our workspace supports Python, R, and Julia. **Please note: For this competition, you will only be using Python.**  Please check out the workspace by clicking on the workspace button in the right corner.  

## Accessing the data in BigQuery
When you register for this new challenge,  you will be able to access a key in your [user profile](https://ironhacks.com/profile) that allows you to query the data using libraries in Python and some basic SQL. Our Tutorial #2, which will be available when registration opens, will tell you more about how to do that. We will release new keys in batches so it might take up to a day until you have access to a key! 

## Your submission

You will be asked to create a predictive statistical model that you can revise over time. You will be asked to produce and submit your results in a Jupyter notebook.  You can learn about the details of your submission in the task statement when it is released to all participants. You will have multiple opportunities for making a great submission. The task statement will detail the submission frequency and requirements, but generally, we strongly recommend you to submit often. 

## Evaluation

Each participant's notebook will be evaluated  in two dimensions using objective metrics: 

* **Prediction accuracy** (your model’s MSPE and MAPE)
* **Individual exploration and learning** (your effort to explore a variety of different models) 

The evaluation metrics and logic will be detailed in the task statement once it has been published. Please also carefully read the Rules when the competition is open for registration. 

## The process

* **Registration and warm-up phase**: When you register for the hack, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials. You will also access to a subset of the data that you can use to get familiar with the data you will be using in the challenge. Registration is planned to open soon and will remain open for a period of time for new participants to join (this registration window is dependent upon challenge criteria for each hack).

* **Your start of the Competition**: The competition starts with you accepting the Rules of the competition.  Once we have released the task, you have to accept the rules of the contest, access your competition key, and start querying BigQuery.
 
 * **Multi-staged interim submission process**: After the release of the task, there are multiple submission opportunities over a six week period of time.  There are two submissions planned for each week so you can be scored two times for the same model focused on a particular week. We will get new data every week so you have the opportunity to tune your model every week further, as you get new data. 

We will create a Calendar for you to learn more about the dates and deadlines below.  

| **Event**                                    | **Date/Time (EST)**                   |

## Skills and tutorials

This fourth IronHacks is designed for participants with intermediate knowledge of statistics and Python. Beginners and more advanced users are also invited to participate. If you have never worked with Jupyter notebook, you can use the warm-up phase to practice. You will have access to check out the tutorials once registration is open. We will release more tutorials as needed. 

## Prizes and awards

In total, we will award several prizes with a total value up to **USD 2000**. More details will be available in the Task Statement, however, at minimum the following prizes and opportunities will be available to the highest scoring submissions. In this hack, you will be awarded based on your individual performance.

## Individual prizes
We will be evaluating individuals based on the two metrics stated above. Please read the task for more details about how we rank individuals.  At minimum, prizes for individuals will be allocated as follows:

1. The First Place will receive a 1yr membership to Matchbox Coworking and consideration to publish or work on platform development with RCODI.
2. The Second Place will receive a 1 yr membership to Matchbox Coworking and consideration to publish or work on platform development with RCODI.

In addition, there are more additional benefits for you:
