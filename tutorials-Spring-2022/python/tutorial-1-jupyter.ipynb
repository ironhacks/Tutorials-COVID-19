    "Welcome to the IronHacks workspace and Juptyer lab. In this first notebook, we will explore the basics of Juptyer Notebooks. We assume you have never used Juptyer Notebooks before! \n",

    "> Before you get started: This tutorial will not more than 3 to 5 min and you should be able use the Notebook right after! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goal**: Help you getting started with .ipnb notebooks as this will be an important format to work with during the IronHacks competition 2020! So if you have never used a notebook before this might something you want try using!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks**: \n",
    "The document you are currently looking at in your lab is a `.ipynb` Notebook or a Juptyer notebook. It is like document. You can write raw text it, but also code, and markdown. \n",
    "In addition, you can use it to query database, display charts etc. So it is truely amazing! We will start with a Juptyer Notebook to introduce to the Juptyer lab as this will be your dominant working mode, and we hope you will like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: This text is formated in Markdown and written in Markdown language in a cell! \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupiter Notebooks in the IronHacks workspace support R, Python, and also Julia. However, for this competition, we only allow R and Python, simply because those are the languages were we have the most packages available to support statistical modeling like th eone needed for this IronHacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Lab**: \n",
    "We assume you have loaded this notebook in the IronHacks workspace. Our workspace is a so called Juptyer lab. JupyterLab 1.0: Jupyterâ€™s Next-Generation Notebook interface! JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. It support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. The Notebook is a central part of it. In addition to it also offers a Console, a terminal, an editor. In addition, to notebooks is allows you to load a range of file types: Markdown (`.md`), text (`.txt`), json (`.json`), htlm (`.htlm`), or csv/tables (`.csv`) etc. In this hack you will primarily work with the notebook and query BigQuery to get access to data (this will follow in **Part II** of our tutorial sessions). \n",
    "\n",
