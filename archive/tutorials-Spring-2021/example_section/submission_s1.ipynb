    "I use linear regression to predict the visit counts. I first extract the week number, POI, and raw visit counts. For each poi, I create a record of the counts for the 23 weeks. Sorr, running out of time. So I paste the following sentence for linear regression: In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable."
