Once you get in, you are greeted with an enviroment similar to any IDE you may have worked with in the past. To create an notebook, all you have to do is hit **File->Create New Notebook** and a new Python notebook will open up. Once you get here, you can start coding! Notebooks typically use cells to section each part you write. You may create Text or Code cells. Text cells will help you explain your code or just keep notes for yourself to help you stay on track. Code cells will be any code that you write that the complier will run. Code cells can be run individually or all at once, making it easier to debug or run code, whichever you may choose when you develop your own code for this challenge.
