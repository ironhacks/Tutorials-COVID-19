    "### Feature extraction/variable transformations performed - \n",

    "I predict the total_claims with edu_post_hs as I believe education has a strong impact on unemployment claims. \n",

    "### Strengths and weaknesses of the model -\n",
    "\n",
    "I think Gradient Boosting Classifier is a strong model for this problem because ensemble methods is able to overcome the noise in the data. \n",
