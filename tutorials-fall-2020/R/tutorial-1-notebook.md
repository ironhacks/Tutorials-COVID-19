## Tutorial 1: Getting to know Juptyer Notbooks

> What is Juptyer Lab? **Juptyer Lab is the generation of Juptyer Notebooks!** 

In this hack, you will be required to use our Juptyer Workspace and Juptyer Notebooks (`.ipnyb`). If you haven't ever used those, we suggest you check out this first tutorials to get you started on a Notebook in 10 min. 

### What is Juptyer Lab and what is a Juptyer Notebook? 
JupyterLab is Jupyterâ€™s Next-Generation Notebook interface! JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. It support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. The Notebook is a central part of it. In addition to it also offers a Console, a terminal, an editor. In addition, to notebooks is allows you to load a range of file types: Markdown (`.md`), text (`.txt`), json (`.json`), htlm (`.htlm`), or csv/tables (`.csv`) etc. In this hack you will mostly work with the Juptyer notebook since notebooks are the required as per the rules of the challenge. 

### Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks by learning by doing

We have developed a notebook so that you can play with Jupyter notebooks with an R Kernel. 
You can find it [here](https://ironhacks.com/notebook-viewer?path=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironhacks/Tutorials-COVID-19/master/tutorials-fall-2020/R/PartI_IntroNotebookR.ipynb). 

1. View it. 
2. download it and 
3. upload it in our IronHacks workspace to use and learn by doing.
