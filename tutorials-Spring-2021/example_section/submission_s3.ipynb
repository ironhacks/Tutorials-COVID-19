    "## Summary of Submission 3\n",
    "For this submission, I used the decision tree model. For the variables, I used top_category and raw_visit_counts, I also added a new column counting down the days when school starts. In order to run the model, I turned the table into a format where I put every single category and location_id into their own column and each row has a different raw_visit_counts. Then I ran the ridge, lasso, decision tree, random forest, and gradient models and compared the testing score and cross-validation scores for each model and found that the decision tree has the highest score out of all of them. So I used the decision tree model to predict week 44's raw_visit_counts. For tomorrow, I will be trying to clean the data in executive_orders and covid19_cases and feed them into the decision tree to see if the prediction score would increase.\n"
